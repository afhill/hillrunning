Today I did the Turkey Chase 10K to benefit the Denver Rescue Mission. it was a two-lap course around a golf course. I had 6 miles on my training plan today anyway so I decided this was a good substitute.

So maybe doing legs at the gym yesterday and having beer and gyros for dinner wasn't the best preparation. Couple that with the chilly course (I was one of perhaps 10 people wearing shorts), and it was not my day.

1 &#8211; 7:46  
2 &#8211; 8:10  
3 &#8211; 7:59  
4 &#8211; 8:18  
5 &#8211; 8:30  
6 &#8211; 7:39  
.2 &#8211; 7:05pace  
&#8212;&#8211;  
50:25 (8:07 pace)

I stuck around afterwards for the awards, and determined that had I wanted hardware, I should have just run the 5K. The winning time was 25:10, and I know I hit the turn around before the girl who placed second finished. Sigh.. It's funny how that happens sometimes, when the faster runners choose the longer course. In the end, I placed 5th female, 2nd in my AG (10-year AGs)

The course was on cement most of the way, and I'll admit that the downhills were a little rough on my quads. Just a reminder to me that not everything is going to be on my nice flat soft track at the gym!

It was still a good day to run: the sun is shining, there isn't a cloud in the sky. Now it's off to relax and enjoy the rest of Thanksgiving (and prepare mentally for the 20 miler this weekend!)

Oh &#8211; and for those of you who think Garmins are perfect, here's the elevation chart from the race. This was a two-lap course so really it should show the same elevation graph twice. It's close, but not quite. That's why I use it for a guide, but don't get too wrapped up in it.
