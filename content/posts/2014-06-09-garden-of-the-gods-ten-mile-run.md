Although the speed isn&#8217;t back yet, the drive to race is! 

Today I ran the [Garden of the Gods Ten Mile Run](http://www.gardentenmile.com/) with Erin. She suggested it in the middle of the week and I decided I may as well as I really like running down by the Springs. However as the weekend drew closer I got a bit more nervous about it.

On Friday I decided that I&#8217;d be happy running 1:30 &#8211; 1:35 for the ten miles, and then on Saturday I reframed that to 1:30 &#8211; 1:40. I honestly haven&#8217;t run 10 miles in awhile and I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would go. 

We went for dinner with friends in Denver before heading out to stay with Erin&#8217;s mom and stepdad last night. We visited for a bit before heading off to bed &#8211; the 5am wakeup call was going to come early!

The forecast called for 30% chance of showers, but the moisture came over the night and it was dry (but overcast) when it came time to run. I wore my Runners Edge tshirt, lululemon shorts, compression socks and hokas. 

We got to Manitou in plenty of time before the start. Erin mentioned how challenging the course was a few times, which was something I hadn&#8217;t really considered. Ha! She just mentioned it was a lot of rolling hills. I decided to just run by feel and do what I could.

And then we started&#8230; and I remembered how much I love races! I wasnt trying to set a record, but it felt good to push. 10 miles is a nice distance &#8211; the mile markers came up pretty quickly and there was nice easy math &#8211; &#8220;20% done!&#8221; 

The aid stations were decorated like movies and the high school students manning the stations were super enthusiastic and encouraging (there is a contest for the best station). It was fun!

I&#8217;m still not 100% recovered so I took my time on some of the uphills and walked. But then I felt strong for the downhills, and my Hokas let me (kinda) fly! 

I did struggle around mile 3 when I started to cramp up. I don&#8217;t know if it was that thirst I had before the race, the gatorade I took, or the altitude. But I spent the next three miles or so looking for a portapotty. :-/ 

The race was a decent size, but the path was narrow enough that you saw people and I had some nice exchanges with a few people (in part because I was alternating walking and running so we were playing cat and mouse). The course itself really was gorgeous. The peak was during mile 4 and then right as you started on your way down, you turned a corner and there was a group of kilted bagpipers. We were winding through the Garden of the Gods&#8217; and there was a light mist as you looked out over the rocks. It was a really special moment. 

At the 5 mile mark they said the hard part was done, and I told them I sure hoped they weren&#8217;t lying! But sure enough, the second half ticked along well. 

By the last mile I felt my stride getting a little weird: i was landing harder on my whole left foot rather than the forefoot. Yet it didnt hurt and didnt seem to impede me in any way, so no harm I guess? 

With just over a mile to go, I was pleased to look at my watch and see 1:21:xx. I was close to my goal! &#8230; and then I hit quicksand. I swear it! Just coming into town I felt like I was slugging along. But then some girl came up cruising in front of me, and my competitive spirit took over. I saw Erin&#8217;s mom and stepdad (and puppy Charley) at the finish, and then I pushed it into gear and crossed the line with 1:31:xx guntime. Goal met ðŸ™‚

I had seen Erin close behind me at a turnaround about 1.5 miles back so I knew she would be finishing shortly. Sure enough, I just had time to recover my warmup shirt from under the tree where I&#8217;d stored it, and they announced her name. HUGE improvement for her over last year &#8211; over a minute per mile!!

We met her folks and walked for a bit. It was really super running weather (ok, I could have probably gotten away with a tank top, but the tshirt was fine) and the course was great. 

My final chip time turned out to be 1:30:46 &#8211; so I absolutely met my goal! It wasnt lost on me that I&#8217;ve run a half marathon in less time than this took me, but so what? This was a hard course in Colorado, and I&#8217;m SO glad I finally got over my own shaming of &#8220;I&#8217;m not fast anymore&#8221; and did it!

I felt just fine afterwards &#8211; legs feel good, and my hip didnt bother me (I was worried about that). And most importantly, I&#8217;m really excited for Pikes Peak in a few months (and another run in the Springs before that). Yep, I think it&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;m back!

It was a really pretty run and I cant definitely say I&#8217;d be interested to do it again and see how to run it differently. While my walking definitely was a good strategy for me at this point, I&#8217;m sure I could do better with more hill training and strength.
