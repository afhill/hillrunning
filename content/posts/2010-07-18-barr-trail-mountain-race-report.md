This morning was the Barr Trail Mountain Race. Last year I ran 2:30:03 and so even though I haven't been running as much, I had in my mind that sub 2:30 would be a nice reasonable goal. I reviewed my splits from last year just to have them in my mind.

The day started out well &#8211; I didn't start as far back to avoid getting caught behind walkers. The sun peaked out a bit around 7:30 but thankfully then hid behind some light cloud cover. I haven't done much trail running this year but I fell into what seems to be my safe spot: jogging the slight inclines to open up my lungs and avoid putting my heel downs. As a result, I passed a lot of people on the inclines who then would pass me again shortly.

I had a goal, but it wasn't too firm. I wanted to have a good run and finish feeling good. 

They check your time at 5 different spots- 4 on the way up and then at the finish. I did mental checks as I hit them.

Spot 1: last year 29.xx, this year it was 30.xx  
Spot 2: didn't remember, hit it at 51.xx (looking back, I hit it at 50.25)  
Spot 3: last year 1:13, this year 1:13  
Spot 4: last year 1:38, this year 1:38

So, I was feeling pretty good at the turn around point. now I just had to head for home!

The downhill was ok, but I suspect the fact I haven't been running on this trail recently came into play from a confidence perspective. As well, I'd taped my feet for arch support and I was developing a nice little blister right on the edge of the tape. I chugged and chugged but the finish line just wasn't where I felt it should be. Finally we were on hydro and I put on the gas at the finish. Still, in the final section I managed to slow down dramatically for a 2:34 finish. (Final results not yet available).

I'm bummed: I'd have expected the uphill would have been worse than the downhill! But as I watched all the bleeding runners head to the first aid station after wiping out careening down the mountain, I realized the importance of &#8220;no fear&#8221;. My extra 5 minutes (yuck, 10% slower than last year for the down!) went to safety.

The numbers tell the story (garmin mile by mile):

            Yikes, that's crazy to see. I have to (of course, because I'm me) wonder if I pushed too hard for the first half and then paid for it. But despite the slower times in the descent, I didn't feel pooped.

            Who knows &#8211; maybe I could just stand to do a bit more speedwork (as well as agility) to make a difference. All I know looking at this is that I think I may look forward to the Ascent in August ðŸ™‚
