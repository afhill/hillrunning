Yesterday I did the CRC One Mile Dash.. first ran out to the start, getting there right at five, then turned around and ran back. I had my garmin set to beep if I went faster than a 5:50 pace to ensure I didnt go out too fast.

I KNOW that running fast for me is all about beating my brain. There is NO good reason why I can maintain an 8min pace for three and a half hours, but find myself walking in a one mile race. Absolutely no good reason.

I started out strong, and sure enough, my watch started beeping right away. I pulled back, and then as the race went on I was bothered not by my watch beeping but by my laboured breathing. I&#8217;m simply not used to that! At the half mile marker I looked at my watch and saw a 6:21 pace (what I ran this in two years ago), and I felt demoralized. I had wanted to go faster this year, and I knew I wouldn&#8217;t pull off a negative split. Ugh. 

Yes, I actually slowed to a walk at 3/4 of a mile. The first guy who passed me said &#8220;you only have a quarter mile to go&#8221;. Yeah, I knew that. I also knew that I HATE running fast, I don&#8217;t like wheezing like a freight engine and I NEED TO DO SPEEDWORK. 

I pulled it in at 6:32. Ok I guess but nothing spectacular. I know I can do better, I just need to be able to push past that &#8216;uncomfortable&#8217; zone.

Oh, and I hit 193bpm, but I&#8217;m sure I could have gone higher.. so the quest for a new max heartrate continues. Maybe on Tues I will go find a hill and really push myself..
