This past weekend, Sara and I attended a retreat based on the book &#8220;[Running with the Mind of Meditation](http://www.amazon.com/Running-Mind-Meditation-Lessons-Training/dp/0307888177/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1441763830&sr=1-1)&#8220;. I'd learned about the retreat a few years ago and was glad when I mentioned it to Sara back in May, she was interesting in attending as well. 

The [retreat](http://www.shambhalamountain.org/program/run915running-mind-meditation/) was at the Shambhala Mountain Center, about 2.5 hours from Denver. I had read a review of the program online at Runners World, but there wasn't a lot of details about the program in advance. We just packed a lot of comfortable clothing (and warm clothing for night!) and set out. I tried to tell my Type-A self that not knowing every second was part of the experience ðŸ™‚ 

We met the 35 people in our program Friday night, and did some introductions as to why we were there. Many of us echoed a loss in the joy of running, so we had that in common. There were quite a few people who had attended previous years, a few of them said they'd had &#8220;an experience&#8221; at the retreat in the past. That was an interesting phrasing, but as the weekend rolled out, I came to learn what they meant.

The days were pretty busy with scheduled activities, but there was also a lot of downtime so you never felt rushed. Every morning there was an optional run or yoga session at 6:30 on the trails around the Center. We got our first taste of the joy of the experience on the first day: the leaders said we'd do an out-and-back and people could turn at 15, 20 or 30 minutes. 30 Minutes in the group was chatting away and getting to know each other when someone pointed out we should probably turn around to get back to breakfast! The time had flown by for everyone, including the instructors, who had each been at this retreat for over a decade. 

Our group tended to gather to eat together every day, the food was really good with vegan and gluten-free options with every meal. They didn't skimp either, there was always a nice big salad bar and then they'd have a buffet with things like eggplant parm (with daiya cheese) or mushroom curry for the vegans and other options for the carnivores. I'm glad there was a lot of food, too, because man was I hungry! 

After breakfast we'd have meditation instruction and &#8220;contemplation&#8221; for 1.5 hours, then we'd head out for a group meditative walk or run. The contemplation was really rewarding, we'd meditate on a phrase or question just to explore what feelings or thoughts came up to us. These included &#8220;why we run&#8221; &#8220;motivation&#8221; and &#8220;what we're grateful for.&#8221; One of my biggest insights of the weekend was realizing that in the end, I dont run for PRs or race placings. I run because I love the outdoors and I love the joy I feel as I propel myself forward over the earth.That was a great thing for me to realize, as that sort of internal motivation is limitless, as opposed to relying on external factors. That's been something I've been conflicted about for awhile. This really helped me recognize what's important to me so I can focus on that and not get caught up in a competitive mindset that can be destructive.

Our mid-day runs lead us by the Great Stupa, a beautiful Buddhist monument. We would circumambulate three times and attempt to do some running meditation. I say &#8220;attempt&#8221; because it was very hard to keep the mind still while running at 8,000 ft! The mid-day run was 30 minutes, but twice a few of us would go out again for another 20-30 minutes just to further enjoy the day.

We had lunch and then a nice long break until our afternoon meditation session. It was interesting how different sitting was from one day to the next. One day it was relatively easy to be still, on others my mind raced like a petulant child. But that was ok. 

We also did yoga outside every day, which was pretty special. Our instructor was actually mentioned in the book as Sakyong's coach. She had a great caring soul, and when she found out Sara and I are planning to go to Maui when we get married, she offered to connect us with a wedding photographer she knows there, etc! The yoga was sometimes tough (we battled two rough bouts of weather: VERY hot one day, and pelting rain the second!) but it felt really good and it helped me remember how important it is to complement my running practice. 

![](/media/2015/09/four.jpg)In the evenings we did a running form clinic and had an intense group conversation around injuries and how we got through them. It started out about physical injuries but people were very honest and open and started discussing emotional challenges they were dealing with. About half the group was teared up at the end of the session, but I think they were tears of relief: that it was ok to let those things out and admit them. It was ok to feel deeply, and it didnt mean you would get further hurt through it. It was just, wow. 

The last day was a shorter day, but we did take the time to go around the circle and share our biggest takeaways. For me, it was the people. At the core, running, yoga and meditation are all personal things, but the entire experience of the weekend was so much more rich sharing it with these great souls.

Of course it's relatively easy to leave something like this feeling rejuvenated only to have &#8216;real life' catch up once you leave the center, but they did a good job at encouraging us to take small steps to incorporate our learnings into our daily lives. Even just 10-15 minutes of meditation or a bit of yoga can make a big difference! So Sara and I are going to check out the Shambhala meditation center by our place, and I set myself a goal to attend yoga at least once weekly (which should be easy, since we have free yoga at my work).

I also felt really fortunate to share the weekend with Sara. Obviously it would have been rewarding to just go on my own, but I felt especially fortunate to have someone on the same wavelength as I am, who I could share the experience with. A few nights we got up in the middle of the night and marveled at the stars, it was a really special time. 

I can definitely see why some folks attend year after year. It was a really special group of people and a beautiful location. We've already discussed attending next year as well. I can definitely see how anyone who cares about wellness and self-improvement could benefit from something like this.
