Thanks, dailymile. I miss my training too.

I guess I neglected to admit it here, but I'm not doing so well. I rebounded from a disappointing Colorado Half Marathon on May 5th and was logging some great miles, and then partway through an easy run with Rick, Laura and Cheri on 5/13 my right knee started to bug me. It had stiffened up pretty bad by the end of the run, and I was limping later that day. 

I took the next day off, and put in an easy couple miles Wednesday and thought I was feeling ok. I met with Shawna, Ashley and Tony on Thursday morning *(5/16) and we started out fine: 8:34, 8:05, 8:11, 8:14, 8:11. Then when we turned to head back to the car, my knee seized up something fierce. I ended up hobbling a few miles home. 

Things have not been good since then. After that first Monday I thought it felt vaguely like when I tore my PCL, but then after the Wednesday I felt more pain on the top and front. I saw Richey Hanson a couple times &#8211; he thought it was my popliteus muscle and taped it up and told me to rest, compress, etc but it's been a couple weeks now and it's still not seeming to improve much. 

I'm feeling really frustrated and a bit nervous about it. This weekend Michael and his girlfriend Desiree came into town (we were supposed to rock climb and do the Bolder Boulder &#8211; I did neither, Michael still ran). Desiree is a PT so she looked at my knee a bit, gave me some exercises to do and taped it as well. I thought it was feeling better but then we did a fair amount of walking over the weekend and by the end of it my knee was sore and kept seizing up and hurting . 

She also said she suspects I have a meniscal tear. 

I requested an appointment with the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine so I guess we'll see what they say. I've resisted getting another MRI (because the last one seemed pretty well useless) but I am feeling helpless so I guess that's at least doing something. 

Tonight I decided to take a look back at this blog and see how long I was out when I tore my PCL. Which made me realize I didn't really admit it outright on this blog (!!). I mentioned I hurt my knee so I wasn't bouting, and then I mention that a doc said I should only work out to my comfort level, but I never spoke really overtly about it. Which is kinda crappy if someone, say, wants to go back a few years later and look at what happened. So, here's the 2013 update. üôÅ

It turns out, it may have been a bad idea because it does look like I never really stopped running with my PCL tear. (I do have some exercise descriptions b/c I was TBTing at the time). Which means that this knee issue is worse than that one. 

I'm supposed to run a 5K with Scott in a couple weeks, and the Seattle half marathon in a month. Seattle is probably not a possibility, but I don't quite want to give up on the possibility of the 5K quite yet. Who knows, maybe there is some miracle that'll happen&#8230; right?? 

In the back of my mind, I'm starting to consider what I'll do this summer if I can't run. Which makes me sad, but I'm not entirely sure it's not a possibility. 

Oh! One more thing about this injury &#8211; it had seemed a bit mysterious &#8211; when I tore my PCL it was upon impact playing derby. This one seemed not to have any sort of trauma. However, just the other day Laura reminded me that during that Monday run we have three small steps to run up, and I'd slipped on one and slammed my foot down. Bingo&#8230; So, that's actually a bit of a relief because I didn't want to think it was due to volume or the fact I'd done some hiking, trail runs, and climbing the week before. 

So, I'm going to try to do better at updating this thing for record-keeping.
