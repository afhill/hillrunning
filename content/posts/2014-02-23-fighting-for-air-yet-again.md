Today was the Fight for Air Stair Climb, and I participated for the fourth time in five years (last year I ran the [Rock and Roll New Orleans Half Marathon](/posts/2013-02-rock-n-roll-new-orleans-half-race-report) instead).

Flashbacks:

I knew that this wasn&#8217;t going to be any sort of record-breaking year. Heck, just a few months ago I&#8217;d struggle to go up the 6 flights of stairs at work due to my knee surgery. However, I do like the event, and work was putting together a team. I very openly let myself be talked into participating. 

The day before I registered, I did the stairs at work: we have 18 stories in our building so I did them 4 times (either walking down or taking the elevator part of the way). The first time, my lungs were feeling kinda rough afterwards, but I didn&#8217;t feel TOO horrible. And actually my knee wasn&#8217;t a factor at all &#8211; good news! I did it again the week before the race and I averaged between 3:46 &#8211; 4:00 for each ascent, so I set myself a goal of sub-13 for the actual race. 

So I met 6 other [ReadyTalkers](http://www.readytalk.com) shortly before noon, and we started our climb. I wore compression socks and my [flipbelt](http://flipbelt.com/) with a small flask of water. I had learned from my time with the COS Incline Fanatics that I&#8217;d want to have my hands free to use the rails. I also wore my garmin, although I knew it wouldn&#8217;t likely impact my pace: I was just going to do what I could. 

Going near the end of the event made it less fun before-hand: there wasn&#8217;t that pre-race excitement in the air. However, it meant things were less crowded, including in the stairway.

I won&#8217;t lie, it was tough. My lungs were definitely burning, and I was really glad I had my water flask. I didnt have a great sense of any sort of desired splits, although when I looked at my watch and it said 9:xx and I had less than 10 flights to go, I knew I was going to demolish my plan!

Indeed, I finished with my watch showing 10:45, although they posted it officially as 10:39. Colleen from work finished ahead of me (I&#8217;d passed her on the stairs but then she passed me back), and Joel actually placed as the second male overall in 7:13 or some ridiculous thing! 

Afterwards I felt like absolute crap, and needed to sit down and regroup for awhile. But I did it! Hours later my lungs keep rattling a little, but I&#8217;m so glad I did it, and I&#8217;m already excited for next year&#8230; ðŸ™‚
