This year I was invited to run the stair climb with the COS Incline Fanatics, the team that's won the danged event for the past 4(?) years. Fun! They are considered an elite team, obviously, which meant an early start time. 

I definitely know I'm a stronger athlete than I was [last year](/posts/2011-02-fight-for-air-stair-climb-race-report/), and since we were starting sooner, I wouldn't have to worry about the congestion at the top like last year. I set my sights on 8:30, secretly wanting to run 8:15 (note: last year's female winning time was 8:12 or so, by a REALLY good runner). 

![](/media/2012-02-skitched-20120226-162410.png)I was feeling tired last night and a bit beat up from our workout, so I actually went to bed at like 9:30pm and slept in my compression socks! I woke up around 5:30 but didn't get out of bed til I had to, shortly after 6. Our start time was 8am (first wave!) so we were supposed to be at the Republic Plaza at 7. I got there and met the guys, and got increasingly nervous ðŸ™‚ they were pretty serious about the thing, Shawn (who's won before and ended up placing 2nd today) asked me if I'd been training in stairwells, and we did some light laps of the stairs to &#8220;warm up&#8221; before lining up. The guys were intent on being the first team, and we lined up according to our predicted pace. Michael Everson was nice enough to offer to start behind me although we were both shooting for 8:30. As we lined up, I felt weird about being so close to the start. I had Denver Fire right behind me, and the Runners Roost team (who'd apparently been spreading the word that they expected to win) were shortly behind as well. I started, and right out the gate hit it too fast. I felt like crap already by the 9th floor, when Mike had already made up the 5 second start I had on him. Apparently he was hoping to push me a little so we'd both get our target time, but that wasn't happening today so he passed me and kept going. 

It was, well, miserable. And to top it off, I'd managed to turn off my watch instead of starting it. I was surprised at how hot it was already in the stairwell with less than a dozen people ahead of me. Yuck! Shawn had mentioned using both rails, so I tried that but they were just slightly too wide and it wasn't the most comfortable. It was a nice tiny break when I'd use the rail to pull myself up a bit and my lungs and heart didn't have to do ALL the work, but it wasn't pleasant. 

My ego took a hit when people passed me, which is ridiculous. I was on the team, it wasn't like I personally felt like I was faster than these guys and I'm reasonably sure none of them thought &#8220;why did this dumb girl line up there&#8221;? 

Because I'd gone out too fast (and possibly because I'd run close to 40 miles this week including a good hard track workout the day before), I didn't have any huge finishing kick to get it done. I heard someone coming behind me but I knew I'd finish before him so I just finished. Frustrated, disappointed in my performance and how amateur I acted at the start. In the past two years I've been much more conservative at the start, which makes the whole thing more enjoyable and gives me some energy at the end. Given the fact I had a clear stairwell ahead of me pretty well the whole time, I could have done SO much better. 

When they finally posted the results, I had a 9:13 or 9:18 or something: slower than last year. I was pretty bummed. Then oddly enough when they posted the results online, it was documented as 9:21. Ugh&#8230;.

After all the elite climbers, the posted results showed me as second female. That placing stood til nearly noon. It was even tweeted by the Colorado Lung Association!

Of course I retweeted it despite my disappointment at my time, and in a conversation with a friend said &#8220;the fast ladies must not have shown up&#8221;.

Well, that was a silly thing for me to post, because then they did. Yup &#8211; two more women from the non-elite teams managed a faster time, so I dropped down to 4th overall. 

I'm frustrated with how it went, and while I know that next year I may just embark on some of this stuff they call &#8216;race-specific training', I also wonder how much yesterday's workout affected my performance, and I know it's not like I will skip a Saturday workout to taper for this event next year. So I have really mixed emotions about my chances to do better. Ugh&#8230;
